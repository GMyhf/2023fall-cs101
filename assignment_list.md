## Assignment #3

#### 118A. String Task

implementation/strings, 1000, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/118/A

Petya started to attend programming lessons. On the first lesson his task was to write a simple program. The program was supposed to do the following: in the given string, consisting if uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, it:

- deletes all the vowels,
- inserts a character "." before each consonant,
- replaces all uppercase consonants with corresponding lowercase ones.

Vowels are letters "A", "O", "Y", "E", "U", "I", and the rest are consonants. The program's input is exactly one string, it should return the output as a single string, resulting after the program's processing the initial string.

Help Petya cope with this easy task.

**Input**

The first line represents input string of Petya's program. This string only consists of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and its length is from 1 to 100, inclusive.

**Output**

Print the resulting string. It is guaranteed that this string is not empty.

#### 263A. Beautiful Matrix

implementation, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/263/A

You've got a 5 × 5 matrix, consisting of 24 zeroes and a single number one. Let's index the matrix rows by numbers from 1 to 5 from top to bottom, let's index the matrix columns by numbers from 1 to 5 from left to right. In one move, you are allowed to apply one of the two following transformations to the matrix:

1. Swap two neighboring matrix rows, that is, rows with indexes *i* and *i* + 1 for some integer *i* (1 ≤ *i* < 5).
2. Swap two neighboring matrix columns, that is, columns with indexes *j* and *j* + 1 for some integer *j* (1 ≤ *j* < 5).

You think that a matrix looks *beautiful*, if the single number one of the matrix is located in its middle (in the cell that is on the intersection of the third row and the third column). Count the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

**Input**

The input consists of five lines, each line contains five integers: the *j*-th integer in the *i*-th line of the input represents the element of the matrix that is located on the intersection of the *i*-th row and the *j*-th column. It is guaranteed that the matrix consists of 24 zeroes and a single number one.

**Output**

Print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

Examples

input

```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1

#### 281A. Word Capitalization

implementation/strings, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/281/A

Capitalization is writing a word with its first letter as a capital letter. Your task is to capitalize the given word.

Note, that during capitalization all the letters except the first one remains unchanged.

**Input**

A single line contains a non-empty word. This word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters. The length of the word will not exceed 10^3^.

**Output**

Output the given word after capitalization.

Examples

input

```
ApPLe
```

output

```
ApPLe
```

input

```
konjac
```

output

```
Konjac
```





#### 282A. Bit++

implementation, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/282/A

The classic programming language of Bitland is Bit++. This language is so peculiar and complicated.

The language is that peculiar as it has exactly one variable, called *x*. Also, there are two operations:

- Operation ++ increases the value of variable *x* by 1.
- Operation -- decreases the value of variable *x* by 1.

A statement in language Bit++ is a sequence, consisting of exactly one operation and one variable *x*. The statement is written without spaces, that is, it can only contain characters "+", "-", "X". Executing a statement means applying the operation it contains.

A programme in Bit++ is a sequence of statements, each of them needs to be executed. Executing a programme means executing all the statements it contains.

You're given a programme in language Bit++. The initial value of *x* is 0. Execute the programme and find its final value (the value of the variable when this programme is executed).

**Input**

The first line contains a single integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 150) — the number of statements in the programme.

Next *n* lines contain a statement each. Each statement contains exactly one operation (++ or --) and exactly one variable *x* (denoted as letter «X»). Thus, there are no empty statements. The operation and the variable can be written in any order.

**Output**

Print a single integer — the final value of *x*.

Examples

input

```
1
++X
```

output

```
1
```

input

```
2
X++
--X
```

output

```
0

#### 339A. Helpful Maths

greedy/implementation/sortings/strings, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/339/A

Xenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.

The teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2 and 3. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+3.

You've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.

**Input**

The first line contains a non-empty string *s* — the sum Xenia needs to count. String *s* contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters "+". Besides, string *s* is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2 and 3. String *s* is at most 100 characters long.

**Output**

Print the new sum that Xenia can count.

Examples

input

```
3+2+1
```

output

```
1+2+3
```

input

```
1+1+3+1+3
```

output

```
1+1+1+3+3
```

input

```
2

#### OJ01017: 装箱问题（选做）

greedy, http://cs101.openjudge.cn/practice/01017

一个工厂制造的产品形状都是长方体，它们的高度都是h，长和宽都相等，一共有六个型号，他们的长宽分别为1\*1, 2\*2, 3\*3, 4\*4, 5\*5, 6\*6。这些产品通常使用一个 6\*6*h 的长方体包裹包装然后邮寄给客户。因为邮费很贵，所以工厂要想方设法的减小每个订单运送时的包裹数量。他们很需要有一个好的程序帮他们解决这个问题从而节省费用。现在这个程序由你来设计。

**输入**：输入文件包括几行，每一行代表一个订单。每个订单里的一行包括六个整数，中间用空格隔开，分别为1*1至6*6这六种产品的数量。输入文件将以6个0组成的一行结尾。

**输出**：除了输入的最后一行6个0以外，输入文件里每一行对应着输出文件的一行，每一行输出一个整数代表对应的订单所需的最小包裹数。

解题思路：4\*4, 5\*5, 6\*6这三种的处理方式较简单，就是每一个箱子至多只能有其中1个，根据他们的数量添加箱子，再用2\*2和1\*1填补。1\*1, 2\*2, 3\*3这些就需要额外分情况讨论，若有剩余的3\*3,每4个3\*3可以填满一个箱子，剩下的3\*3用2\*2和1\*1填补装箱。剩余的2\*2，每9个可以填满一个箱子，剩下的与1\*1一起装箱。最后每36个1\*1可以填满一个箱子，剩下的为一箱子。

## Assignment #2

#### 71A. Way Too Long Words

strings, 1000, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/71/A

Sometimes some words like "*localization*" or "*internationalization*" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.

Let's consider a word *too long*, if its length is **strictly more** than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Thus, "*localization*" will be spelt as "*l10n*", and "*internationalization*" will be spelt as "i18n".

You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.

**Input**

The first line contains an integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100). Each of the following *n* lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and possess the lengths of from 1 to 100 characters.

**Output**

Print *n* lines. The *i*-th line should contain the result of replacing of the *i*-th word from the input data.

Examples

input

```
4
word
localization
internationalization
pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
```

output

```

#### 112A. Petya and Strings

implementation/strings, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/112/A

Little Petya loves presents. His mum bought him two strings of the same size for his birthday. The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. Now Petya wants to compare those two strings lexicographically. The letters' case does not matter, that is an uppercase letter is considered equivalent to the corresponding lowercase letter. Help Petya perform the comparison.

**Input**

Each of the first two lines contains a bought string. The strings' lengths range from 1 to 100 inclusive. It is guaranteed that the strings are of the same length and also consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.

**Output**

If the first string is less than the second one, print "-1". If the second string is less than the first one, print "1". If the strings are equal, print "0". Note that the letters' case is not taken into consideration when the strings are compared.

Examples

input

```
aaaa
aaaA
```

output

```
0
```

input

```
abs
Abz
```

output

```
-1
```

input

```
abcdefg
AbCdEfF
```

output

```
1
```

Note

If you want more formal information about the lexicographical order (also known as the "dictionary order" or "alphabetical order"), you can visit the following site:

#### 158A. Next Round

*special problem/implementation, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/158/A

"Contestant who earns a score equal to or greater than the *k*-th place finisher's score will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant earns a positive score..." — an excerpt from contest rules.

A total of *n* participants took part in the contest (*n* ≥ *k*), and you already know their scores. Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *k* (1 ≤ *k* ≤ *n* ≤ 50) separated by a single space.

The second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*~1~, *a*~2~, ..., a~n~ (0 ≤ a~i~ ≤ 100), where a~i~ is the score earned by the participant who got the *i*-th place. The given sequence is non-increasing (that is, for all *i* from 1 to *n* - 1 the following condition is fulfilled: a~i~ ≥ a~i~ + 1).

**Output**

Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.

Examples

input

```
8 5
10 9 8 7 7 7 5 5
```

output

```
6
```

input

```
4 2
0 0 0 0
```

output

```
0
```

Note

In the first example the participant on the 5th place earned 7 points. As the participant on the 6th place also earned 7 points, there are 6 advancers.

In the second example nobody got a positive score.



#### 58A. Chat room

greedy/strings, 1000, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/58/A

Vasya has recently learned to type and log on to the Internet. He immediately entered a chat room and decided to say hello to everybody. Vasya typed the word *s*. It is considered that Vasya managed to say hello if several letters can be deleted from the typed word so that it resulted in the word "hello". For example, if Vasya types the word "ahhellllloou", it will be considered that he said hello, and if he types "hlelo", it will be considered that Vasya got misunderstood and he didn't manage to say hello. Determine whether Vasya managed to say hello by the given word *s*.

**Input**

The first and only line contains the word *s*, which Vasya typed. This word consisits of small Latin letters, its length is no less that 1 and no more than 100 letters.

**Output**

If Vasya managed to say hello, print "YES", otherwise print "NO".

Examples

input

```
ahhellllloou
```

output

```
YES
```

input

```

#### OJ01008: Maya Calendar（选做）

math, http://cs101.openjudge.cn/practice/01008/

During his last sabbatical, professor M. A. Ya made a surprising discovery about the old Maya calendar. From an old knotted message, professor discovered that the Maya civilization used a 365 day long year, called Haab, which had 19 months. Each of the first 18 months was 20 days long, and the names of the months were pop, no, zip, zotz, tzec, xul, yoxkin, mol, chen, yax, zac, ceh, mac, kankin, muan, pax, koyab, cumhu. Instead of having names, the days of the months were denoted by numbers starting from 0 to 19. The last month of Haab was called uayet and had 5 days denoted by numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The Maya believed that this month was unlucky, the court of justice was not in session, the trade stopped, people did not even sweep the floor. For religious purposes, the Maya used another calendar in which the year was called Tzolkin (holly year). The year was divided into thirteen periods, each 20 days long. Each day was denoted by a pair consisting of a number and the name of the day. They used 20 names: imix, ik, akbal, kan, chicchan, cimi, manik, lamat, muluk, ok, chuen, eb, ben, ix, mem, cib, caban, eznab, canac, ahau and 13 numbers; both in cycles. Notice that each day has an unambiguous description. For example, at the beginning of the year the days were described as follows: 1 imix, 2 ik, 3 akbal, 4 kan, 5 chicchan, 6 cimi, 7 manik, 8 lamat, 9 muluk, 10 ok, 11 chuen, 12 eb, 13 ben, 1 ix, 2 mem, 3 cib, 4 caban, 5 eznab, 6 canac, 7 ahau, and again in the next period 8 imix, 9 ik, 10 akbal . . . Years (both Haab and Tzolkin) were denoted by numbers 0, 1, . . . , where the number 0 was the beginning of the world. Thus, the first day was: Haab: 0. pop 0 Tzolkin: 1 imix 0 Help professor M. A. Ya and write a program for him to convert the dates from the Haab calendar to the Tzolkin calendar. 

**输入**

The date in Haab is given in the following format:
NumberOfTheDay. Month Year

The first line of the input file contains the number of the input dates in the file. The next n lines contain n dates in the Haab calendar format, each in separate line. The year is smaller then 5000.

**输出**

The date in Tzolkin should be in the following format:
Number NameOfTheDay Year

The first line of the output file contains the number of the output dates. In the next n lines, there are dates in the Tzolkin calendar format, in the order corresponding to the input dates.

#### OJ01218:THE DRUNK JAILER

http://cs101.openjudge.cn/practice/01218/

A certain prison contains a long hall of n cells, each right next to each other. Each cell has a prisoner in it, and each cell is locked.
One night, the jailer gets bored and decides to play a game. For round 1 of the game, he takes a drink of whiskey,and then runs down the hall unlocking each cell. For round 2, he takes a drink of whiskey, and then runs down the
hall locking every other cell (cells 2, 4, 6, ?). For round 3, he takes a drink of whiskey, and then runs down the hall. He visits every third cell (cells 3, 6, 9, ?). If the cell is locked, he unlocks it; if it is unlocked, he locks it. He
repeats this for n rounds, takes a final drink, and passes out.
Some number of prisoners, possibly zero, realizes that their cells are unlocked and the jailer is incapacitated. They immediately escape.
Given the number of cells, determine how many prisoners escape jail.

**输入**

The first line of input contains a single positive integer. This is the number of lines that follow. Each of the following lines contains a single integer between 5 and 100, inclusive, which is the number of cells n.
