### What is Greedy Algorithm?

> Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are the best fit for Greedy.

For example consider the [Fractional Knapsack Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fractional-knapsack-problem/). The local optimal strategy is to choose the item that has maximum value vs weight ratio. This strategy also leads to a globally optimal solution because we are allowed to take fractions of an item.

A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree.

##### Introduction to Kruskal’s Algorithm:

Here we will discuss **Kruskal’s algorithm** to find the MST of a given weighted graph. 

In Kruskal’s algorithm, sort all edges of the given graph in increasing order. Then it keeps on adding new edges and nodes in the MST if the newly added edge does not form a cycle. It picks the minimum weighted edge at first and the maximum weighted edge at last. Thus we can say that it makes a locally optimal choice in each step in order to find the optimal solution. Hence this is a Greedy Algorithm.

##### How to find MST using Kruskal’s algorithm?

Below are the steps for finding MST using Kruskal’s algorithm:

1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight. 
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If the cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it. 
3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.

> **Step 2** uses the [Union-Find algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-find/) to detect cycles.

Kruskal’s algorithm to find the minimum cost spanning tree uses the greedy approach. The Greedy Choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that does not cause a cycle in the MST constructed so far. Let us understand it with an example:

```

**Time Complexity:** O(E * logE) or O(E * logV) 

- Sorting of edges takes O(E * logE) time. 
- After sorting, we iterate through all edges and apply the find-union algorithm. The find and union operations can take at most O(logV) time.
- So overall complexity is O(E * logE + E * logV) time. 
- The value of E can be at most O(V2), so O(logV) and O(logE) are the same. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(E * logE) or O(E*logV)

**Auxiliary Space:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

## CF1868A. Fill in the Matrix

constructive algorithms, implementation, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1868/A



https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/116642

**Hint 1**

What is the upper bound of 𝑠 according to 𝑛 and 𝑚? Can you construct such a matrix that reaches the upper bound?

**Hint 2**

If not, can you construct a matrix which maximizes$ ∑𝑚^m_{i=1}=𝑣_𝑖$? This is of some help to get the solution.

**Solution**

On one hand, the matrix 𝑀 has 𝑛 rows, so the maxmium 𝑣𝑖does not exceed $MEX(0,1,⋯,𝑛−1)=𝑛$, and 𝑠 does not exceed 𝑛+1.

On the other hand, the matrix 𝑀 has 𝑚 columns, and there are only 𝑚 numbers in the array 𝑣, so 𝑠 must not exceed 𝑚.

Therefore, the upper bound of 𝑠 is $min(𝑛+1,𝑚)$.

How can we reach the upper bound?

If 𝑚=1, then the only possible 
$$
𝑀=
\left(
\matrix{
  0 \\
  0 \\
  \vdots \\
  0 
}
\right)
$$
 in this case, 𝑣1=1, so 𝑠 must be 0, which unfortunately cannot reach the upper bound. ~~Sadly, many participants failed on pretest 2 because of it.~~ I've added this test to examples:)

If 𝑚>1, let's construct the 𝑀 in two cases:

- **Case 1. 𝑚≥𝑛+1.**

  In this case, we can construct 𝑀 like following:

  
  $$
  𝑀=
  \left(
  \matrix{
    0 & 1 & ... & m-2 & m-1\\
    1 & 2 & ... & m-1 & 0\\
    2 & 3 & ... & 0 & 1\\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
    n-1 & n & ... & n-3 & n-2 
  }
  \right)
  $$
  

  More formally, $𝑀_{𝑖,𝑗}=(𝑖+𝑗−1) \; mod \; 𝑚$.

  Note that in this case 𝑛−1<𝑚−1, so we have $𝑣_1=𝑛, 𝑣_2=𝑣_3=⋯=𝑣_{𝑚−𝑛−1}=0, 𝑣_{𝑚−𝑛}=1,𝑣_{𝑚−𝑛+1}=2,⋯,𝑣_𝑚=𝑛−1$. Then 𝑠=𝑛+1, which reaches the upper bound.

- **Case 2. 𝑚<𝑛+1.**

  In this case, we can construct 𝑀 like following:
  $$
  𝑀=
  \left(
  \matrix{
    0 & 1 & ... & m-2 & m-1\\
    1 & 2 & ... & m-1 & 0\\
    2 & 3 & ... & 0 & 1\\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
    m-2 & m-1 & ... & m-4 & m-3\\
    0 & 1 & ... & m-2 & m-1\\
    0 & 1 & ... & m-2 & m-1\\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
    0 & 1 & ... & m-2 & m-1
  }
  \right)
  $$
  
  
  

  More formally, for $1≤𝑗≤𝑚−1, 𝑀_{𝑖,𝑗}=(𝑖+𝑗−1) \; mod \; 𝑚, for 𝑚≤𝑗≤𝑛, 𝑀_{𝑖,𝑗}=(𝑗−1) \; mod \; 𝑚$.

  Note that 𝑚>1, and 𝑚−2≥0. Similarly to case 1 we can get $𝑠=𝑚$, which also reaches the upper bound.

Time Complexity:  O(𝑛⋅𝑚) per test case.

**Implementation**

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define all(s) s.begin(), s.end()
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using ull = unsigned long long;

const int _N = 1e5 + 5;

int T;

void solve() {
	int n, m;
	cin >> n >> m;
	if (m == 1) cout << 0 << '\n';
	else if (n > m - 1) cout << m << '\n';
	else cout << n + 1 << '\n';
	for (int i = 0; i < min(m - 1, n); i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
			cout << (j + i) % m << ' ';
		}
		cout << '\n';
	}
	if (n > m - 1) {
		for (int i = m - 1; i < n; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
				cout << j << ' ';
			}
			cout << '\n';
		}
	}
	return;
}

int main() {
	ios::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
	cin >> T;
	while (T--) {
		solve();
	}
}

# **Dynamic Programming**

## What is Dynamic Programming?

Recursion is an effective problem-solving technique. The key points to remember are as follows:

•All recursive algorithms must have a base case.

•A recursive algorithm must change its state and make progress toward the base case.

•A recursive algorithm must call itself (recursively).

•Recursion can take the place of iteration in some cases.

•Recursive algorithms often map very naturally to a formal expression of the problem you are trying to solve.

•Recursion is not always the answer. 

•Sometimes a recursive solution may be more computationally expensive than an dynamic programming algorithm.

How to use OESIS (On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences)

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-oesis/

Last Updated : 10 Feb, 2018



We sometimes land up in a situation when various coding problems can be simplified to a mathematical formula but often finding that formula isn’t that straightforward .Here comes, OESIS for rescue. We can calculate the terms for initial indices i.e n=0,1,2,3,…….. and then may use OEIS to find the mathematical expression.

This article focuses on using [OEIS](https://oeis.org/) (On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences) to solve many complex problems easily by formulating them in some sort of mathematical expression. OEIS is a massive encyclopedia where we can look for various sequences and find their mathematical expression,examples and related facts about them .

Lets try to understand using an example: You are given n balls and are supposed to make equilateral triangle as shown in the image below.Each subsequent pattern should add a new row  to the triangle.

![OESIS_GeeksforGeeks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMyhf/img/main/img/TriangularNumber_.png)



Now if we see the sequence of dots being added to form triangle,

The first few numbers are `1, 3, 6, 10, 15`…

This problem is known as **triangular number** which counts the objects that can form an equilateral triangle,. The *n*th triangular number is the number of dots composing a triangle with *n* dots on a side, and is equal to the sum of the *n* natural numbers from 1 to *n*. The sequence of triangular numbers starting at the 0th triangular number, is:

0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 ….

Now we have got the sequence and if we search it on [OEIS](https://oeis.org/search?q=1%2C%2C3%2C6%2C10&sort=&language=&go=Search) ,we get the following result:

![o](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMyhf/img/main/img/TriangularNumber_1.png)
OESIS proves extremely helpful in finding the algorithm to solve the problem.OEIS records information on integer sequences of interest to both professional [mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician) and [amateurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_mathematics), and is widely cited. As of 22 August 2015 it contains over 260,000 sequences, making it the largest database of its kind.

# Data Structure

三个常用的数据结构：stack, queue, heap, disjoint set



## Introduction to Disjoint Set (Union-Find Algorithm)

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-disjoint-set-data-structure-or-union-find-algorithm/

### What is a Disjoint set data structure?

> Two sets are called **disjoint sets** if they don’t have any element in common, the intersection of sets is a null set.

A data structure that stores non overlapping or disjoint subset of elements is called disjoint set data structure. The disjoint set data structure supports following operations:

- Adding new sets to the disjoint set.
- Merging disjoint sets to a single disjoint set using **Union** operation.
- Finding representative of a disjoint set using **Find** operation.
- Check if two sets are disjoint or not. 

Consider a situation with a number of persons and the following tasks to be performed on them:

- Add a **new friendship relation**, i.e. a person x becomes the friend of another person y i.e adding new element to a set.
- Find whether individual **x is a friend of individual y** (direct or indirect friend)

**Examples:** 

> We are given 10 individuals say, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j
>
> Following are relationships to be added:
> a <-> b  
> b <-> d
> c <-> f
> c <-> i
> j <-> e
> g <-> j
>
> Given queries like whether a is a friend of d or not. We basically need to create following 4 groups and maintain a quickly accessible connection among group items:
> G1 = {a, b, d}
> G2 = {c, f, i}
> G3 = {e, g, j}
> G4 = {h}



**Find whether x and y belong to the same group or not, i.e. to find if x and y are direct/indirect friends.**

Partitioning the individuals into different sets according to the groups in which they fall. This method is known as a **Disjoint set Union** which maintains a collection of **Disjoint sets** and each set is represented by one of its members.

**To answer the above question two key points to be considered are:**

- **How to Resolve sets?** Initially, all elements belong to different sets. After working on the given relations, we select a member as a **representative**. There can be many ways to select a representative, a simple one is to select with the biggest index.
- **Check if 2 persons are in the same group?** If representatives of two individuals are the same, then they’ll become friends.



**Data Structures used are:** 

**Array:** An array of integers is called **Parent[]**. If we are dealing with **N** items, i’th element of the array represents the i’th item. More precisely, the i’th element of the Parent[] array is the parent of the i’th item. These relationships create one or more virtual trees.

**Tree:** It is a **Disjoint set**. If two elements are in the same tree, then they are in the same **Disjoint set**. The root node (or the topmost node) of each tree is called the **representative** of the set. There is always a single **unique representative** of each set. A simple rule to identify a representative is if ‘i’ is the representative of a set, then **Parent[i] = i**. If i is not the representative of his set, then it can be found by traveling up the tree until we find the representative.



### **Operations on Disjoint Set Data Structures:**

1. Find
2. Union

#### **1. Find:**

Can be implemented by recursively traversing the parent array until we hit a node that is the parent of itself.



```python
# Finds the representative of the set
# that i is an element of

def find(i):

	# If i is the parent of itself
	if (parent[i] == i):

		# Then i is the representative of
		# this set
		return i
	else:

		# Else if i is not the parent of
		# itself, then i is not the
		# representative of his set. So we
		# recursively call Find on its parent
		return find(parent[i])

# The code is contributed by Nidhi goel

```



**Time complexity**: This approach is inefficient and can take O(n) time in worst case.



#### **2. Union:** 

It takes **two elements** as input and finds the representatives of their sets using the **Find** operation, and finally puts either one of the trees (representing the set) under the root node of the other tree.

```python
# Unites the set that includes i
# and the set that includes j

def union(parent, rank, i, j):
	# Find the representatives
	# (or the root nodes) for the set
	# that includes i
	irep = find(parent, i)
	
	# And do the same for the set
	# that includes j
	jrep = find(parent, j)
	
	# Make the parent of i’s representative
	# be j’s representative effectively
	# moving all of i’s set into j’s set)
	
	parent[irep] = jrep

```



**Optimizations (Union by Rank/Size and Path Compression):**

The efficiency depends heavily on which tree get attached to the other***\*.\**** There are 2 ways in which it can be done. First is Union by Rank, which considers height of the tree as the factor and Second is Union by Size, which considers size of the tree as the factor while attaching one tree to the other . This method along with Path Compression gives complexity of nearly constant time.



**[Path Compression](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-find-algorithm-set-2-union-by-rank/) (Modifications to Find()):**

It speeds up the data structure by **compressing the height** of the trees. It can be achieved by inserting a small caching mechanism into the **Find** operation. Take a look at the code for more details:

```python
# Finds the representative of the set that i
# is an element of.


def find(i):

	# If i is the parent of itself
	if Parent[i] == i:

		# Then i is the representative 
		return i
	else:

		# Recursively find the representative.
		result = find(Parent[i])

		# We cache the result by moving i’s node 
		# directly under the representative of this
		# set
		Parent[i] = result
	
		# And then we return the result
		return result

# The code is contributed by Arushi Jindal. 

```



**Time Complexity**: O(log n) on average per call.



### **[Union by Rank](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-by-rank-and-path-compression-in-union-find-algorithm/):**

First of all, we need a new array of integers called **rank[]**. The size of this array is the same as the parent array **Parent[]**. If i is a representative of a set, **rank[i]** is the height of the tree representing the set. 
Now recall that in the Union operation, it doesn’t matter which of the two trees is moved under the other. Now what we want to do is minimize the height of the resulting tree. If we are uniting two trees (or sets), let’s call them left and right, then it all depends on the **rank of left** and the **rank of right**. 

- If the rank of **left** is less than the rank of **right**, then it’s best to move **left under right**, because that won’t change the rank of right (while moving right under left would increase the height). In the same way, if the rank of right is less than the rank of left, then we should move right under left.
- If the ranks are equal, it doesn’t matter which tree goes under the other, but the rank of the result will always be one greater than the rank of the trees.



```c++
// Unites the set that includes i and the set
// that includes j by rank

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void unionbyrank(int i, int j) {

	// Find the representatives (or the root nodes)
	// for the set that includes i
	int irep = this.find(i);

	// And do the same for the set that includes j
	int jrep = this.Find(j);

	// Elements are in same set, no need to
	// unite anything.
	if (irep == jrep)
		return;
	
	// Get the rank of i’s tree
	irank = Rank[irep],

	// Get the rank of j’s tree
	jrank = Rank[jrep];

	// If i’s rank is less than j’s rank
	if (irank < jrank) {

		// Then move i under j
		this.parent[irep] = jrep;
	}

	// Else if j’s rank is less than i’s rank
	else if (jrank < irank) {

		// Then move j under i
		this.Parent[jrep] = irep;
	}

	// Else if their ranks are the same
	else {

		// Then move i under j (doesn’t matter
		// which one goes where)
		this.Parent[irep] = jrep;

		// And increment the result tree’s
		// rank by 1
		Rank[jrep]++;
	}
}

```



### **Union by Size:**

Again, we need a new array of integers called **size[]**. The size of this array is the same as the parent array **Parent[]**. If i is a representative of a set, **size[i]** is the number of the elements in the tree representing the set. 
Now we are uniting two trees (or sets), let’s call them left and right, then in this case it all depends on the **size of left** and the **size of right** tree (or set).

- If the size of **left** is less than the size of **right**, then it’s best to move **left under right** and increase size of right by size of left. In the same way, if the size of right is less than the size of left, then we should move right under left. and increase size of left by size of right.
- If the sizes are equal, it doesn’t matter which tree goes under the other.

```c++
// Unites the set that includes i and the set
// that includes j by size

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void unionbysize(int i, int j) {

	// Find the representatives (or the root nodes)
	// for the set that includes i
	int irep = this.find(i);

	// And do the same for the set that includes j
	int jrep = this.Find(j);

	// Elements are in same set, no need to
	// unite anything.
	if (irep == jrep)
		return;
	
	// Get the size of i’s tree
	isize = Size[irep],

	// Get the size of j’s tree
	jsize = Size[jrep];

	// If i’s size is less than j’s size
	if (isize < jsize) {

		// Then move i under j
		this.parent[irep] = jrep;
	
	// Increment j's size by i'size
		Size[jrep]+=Size[irep];
	}

	// Else if j’s rank is less than i’s rank
	else if (jsize < isize) {

		// Then move j under i
		this.Parent[jrep] = irep;
	
	// Increment i's size by j'size
		Size[irep]+=Size[jrep];
	}

	// Else if their ranks are the same
	else {

		// Then move i under j (doesn’t matter
		// which one goes where)
		this.Parent[irep] = jrep;

		// Increment j's size by i'size
		Size[jrep]+=Size[irep];
	}
}

```



**Time complexity**: O(log n) without Path Compression.



**Below is the complete implementation of disjoint set with path compression and union by rank.**

```python
# Python3 program to implement Disjoint Set Data
# Structure.

class DisjSet:
	def __init__(self, n):
		# Constructor to create and
		# initialize sets of n items
		self.rank = [1] * n
		self.parent = [i for i in range(n)]


	# Finds set of given item x
	def find(self, x):
		
		# Finds the representative of the set
		# that x is an element of
		if (self.parent[x] != x):
			
			# if x is not the parent of itself
			# Then x is not the representative of
			# its set,
			self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
			
			# so we recursively call Find on its parent
			# and move i's node directly under the
			# representative of this set

		return self.parent[x]


	# Do union of two sets represented
	# by x and y.
	def Union(self, x, y):
		
		# Find current sets of x and y
		xset = self.find(x)
		yset = self.find(y)

		# If they are already in same set
		if xset == yset:
			return

		# Put smaller ranked item under
		# bigger ranked item if ranks are
		# different
		if self.rank[xset] < self.rank[yset]:
			self.parent[xset] = yset

		elif self.rank[xset] > self.rank[yset]:
			self.parent[yset] = xset

		# If ranks are same, then move y under
		# x (doesn't matter which one goes where)
		# and increment rank of x's tree
		else:
			self.parent[yset] = xset
			self.rank[xset] = self.rank[xset] + 1

# Driver code
obj = DisjSet(5)
obj.Union(0, 2)
obj.Union(4, 2)
obj.Union(3, 1)
if obj.find(4) == obj.find(0):
	print('Yes')
else:
	print('No')
if obj.find(1) == obj.find(0):
	print('Yes')
else:
	print('No')

# This code is contributed by ng24_7.

```



**Time complexity**: O(n) for creating n single item sets . The two techniques -path compression with the union by rank/size, the time complexity will reach nearly constant time. It turns out, that the final[ amortized time complexity](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-amortized-analysis/) is O(α(n)), where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very steadily (it does not even exceed for n<10600  approximately).

**Space complexity:** O(n) because we need to store n elements in the Disjoint Set Data Structure.

## 浅拷贝、深拷贝

These data structures are internally represented with index arrays, which label the data, and data arrays, which contain the actual data. Now, when we try to copy these data structures we essentially copy the object’s indices and data and there are two ways to do so, namely Shallow Copy and Deep Copy. 

When a shallow copy of a object is created, it doesn’t copy the indices and the data of the original object but it simply copies the references to its indices and data. As a result of which, a change made to one is reflected in the other one. 

It refers to constructing a new collection object and then populating it with references to the child objects found in the original. The copying process does not recurse and therefore won’t create copies of the child objects themselves. 

A deep copy of a object has its own copy of index and data. It is a process in which the copying process occurs recursively. It means first constructing a new collection object and then recursively populating it with copies of the child objects found in the original. In the case of deep copy, a copy of an object is copied into another object. It means that any changes made to a copy of the object do not reflect in the original object. 



### copy in Python (Deep Copy and Shallow Copy)

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-python-deep-copy-shallow-copy/

In [Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/), Assignment statements do not copy objects, they create bindings between a target and an object. When we use the **=** operator, It only creates a new variable that shares the reference of the original object. In order to create “real copies” or “clones” of these objects, we can use the copy module in [Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/).

**Syntax of Deep copy**

> **Syntax:** copy.deepcopy(x)

**Syntax of Shallow copy**

> **Syntax:** copy.copy(x)

**Example:**

In order to make these copies, we use the copy module. The copy() returns a shallow copy of the list, and deepcopy() returns a deep copy of the list. As you can see that both have the same value but have different IDs.

```python
import copy

# initializing list 0
li0 = [1, 2, [3, 5], 4]
print("li0 ID: ", id(li0))

li1 = li0
print("li1 ID: ", id(li1))
print('assignment: ', id(li0) == id(li1), end=',')
print(id(li0[2]) == id(li1[2]))
print()

# using copy for shallow copy
li2 = copy.copy(li0)
print("li2 ID: ", id(li2))
print('shallow_copy: ', id(li0) == id(li2), end=',')
print(id(li0[2]) == id(li2[2]))
print()

# using deepcopy for deepcopy
li3 = copy.deepcopy(li0)
print("li3 ID: ", id(li3))
print('deep_copy ',id(li0) == id(li3), end=',')
print(id(li0[2]) == id(li3[2]))
'''
Important Points: The difference between shallow and deep copying is 
only relevant for compound objects (objects that contain other objects, 
like lists or class instances):

A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then 
(to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects 
found in the original.
A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, 
inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.

### 需要先申请到内存空间，才能使用

指针是内存地址，类似门牌号，要找人得到具体物理位置，门牌号里面找不到。

例如：ma=[[0]\*(m+2)]*(n+2) 只是一个指针，还没有拿到空间。

在Python中，变量 `ma` 的赋值 `[[0]*(m+2)]*(n+2)` 只是创建了一个指向空间的引用，并没有实际申请到内存空间。

需要注意的是，这种方式创建二维列表时，内层列表的元素实际上是共享的，它们指向同一块内存空间。这意味着如果你修改了其中一个内层列表的元素，会影响到其他内层列表中对应位置的元素。

如果你想创建独立的内层列表，可以使用列表推导式来实现，例如：

```
ma = [[0] * (m + 2) for _ in range(n + 2)]
```

这样每个内层列表都会有自己独立的内存空间，避免了共享元素的问题。

# Python内置函数运行速度

python内置函数执行特别快，如sort, find，即使用同样方法实现，也没有直接调用函数快。是因为内置函数都是C语言实现编译成可执行文件库了？

是的，Python内置函数在执行速度上通常会比用纯Python代码实现的相同功能更快。这是因为很多内置函数（如`sort`、`find`等）实际上是用C语言实现的，并且在Python解释器中以编译成的可执行文件库的形式存在。相比于纯Python代码，C语言的执行速度更快，这是由于C语言的底层实现更加高效。因此，当使用内置函数时，Python解释器可以直接调用这些C语言实现的函数，从而获得更快的执行速度。

另外，Python解释器本身也会对一些常用的操作进行优化，比如将循环展开、使用位运算等技巧，以提高执行效率。这些优化也可以帮助内置函数获得更好的性能。

需要注意的是，并不是所有的内置函数都是用C语言实现的，有一些内置函数的实现可能是用Python编写的。但是，Python标准库中的绝大部分内置函数都是用C实现的，因此它们通常具有很高的执行速度。

## 01742: Coins

dp, http://cs101.openjudge.cn/routine/01742/

People in Silverland use coins.They have coins of value A1,A2,A3...An Silverland dollar.One day Tony opened his money-box and found there were some coins.He decided to buy a very nice watch in a nearby shop. He wanted to pay the exact price(without change) and he known the price would not more than m.But he didn't know the exact price of the watch.
You are to write a program which reads n,m,A1,A2,A3...An and C1,C2,C3...Cn corresponding to the number of Tony's coins of value A1,A2,A3...An then calculate how many prices(form 1 to m) Tony can pay use these coins.

**输入**

The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n(1<=n<=100),m(m<=100000).The second line contains 2n integers, denoting A1,A2,A3...An,C1,C2,C3...Cn (1<=Ai<=100000,1<=Ci<=1000). The last test case is followed by two zeros.

**输出**

For each test case output the answer on a single line.

多重背包问题 (二进制优化)
多重背包问题通常可转化成01背包问题求解。但若将每种物品的数量拆分成多个1的话，时间复杂度会很高，
从而导致TLE。所以，需要利用二进制优化思想。即:一个正整数n，可以被分解成1,2,4,...,2^(k-1),
n-2^k+1的形式。其中，k是满足n-2^k+1>0的最大整数。
例如，假设给定价值为2，数量为10的物品，依据二进制优化思想可将10分解为1+2+4+3，则原来价值为2,
数量为10的物品可等效转化为价值分别为1*2，2*2，4*2，3*2，即价值分别为2，4，8，6，数量均为1的物品。
